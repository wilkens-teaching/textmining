## Summary
A technical, undergraduate-level course in quantitive and computational approaches to analyzing large bodies of text. 

## Description

Broadly speaking, the course covers text mining, content analysis, and basic machine learning, emphasizing (but not limited to) approaches with demonstrated value in literary studies. Students will learn how to clean and process textual corpora, extract information from unstructured texts, identify relevant textual and extra-textual features, assess document similarity, cluster and classify authors and texts using a variety of machine-learning methods, visualize the outputs of statistical models, and incorporate quantitative evidence into literary and humanistic analysis.

Most of the methods treated in the class are relevant in other fields. Students from all majors are welcome. No prerequisites, but some programming experience strongly recommended. Taught in Python. Counts toward the Digital Humanities track of the [Idzik Computing and Digital Technologies (CDT)](https://cdt.nd.edu/) minor and as a free elective in the [Data Science minor](https://datascienceminor.nd.edu/).  

## Texts

### Required

Bengfort, Benjamin, Rebecca Bilbro, and Tony Ojeda.[ _Applied Text Analysis with Python_](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052555.do). O'Reilly, 2018.\
See the book's [associated GitHub repo](https://github.com/foxbook/atap) for code samples and related data sets.

### Optional

Guttag, John V. [_Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-computation-and-programming-using-python-second-edition). 2nd. ed. MIT, 2016.\
Useful for students without a strong background in Python. See linked MIT Press site for code samples and information about the associated EdX course.

Raschka, Sebastian and Vahid Mirjalili. [_Python Machine Learning_](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/python-machine-learning-second-edition). 2nd ed. Packt, 2017.\
A more general-purpose textbook on machine learning. Greater emphasis on neural networks, less on working with textual data.

## Objectives

The primary objective of the course is to build proficiency in applied text analysis and data mining. Students who complete the course will have knowledge of standard approaches to text analysis and will be familiar with the humanistic ends to which those approaches might be put. Secondary objectives include acquiring basic understanding of relevant literary history, of integrating quantitative with qualitative evidence, and of best practices in data science project management.

## Work and grading

In addition to weekly problem sets, you will be required to complete one project proposal of about 1,000 words, a brief in-class presentation, and a final project that employs computational techniques covered in the course. Overall grades will be based on the problem sets (35% in sum), proposal (7%), presentation (3%), final project (40%), and class participation (15%). _You must satisfactorily complete all assignments to pass the course._


## Policy statements

### Attendance

Two absences (one week of meetings), no questions asked. Additional absences will lower your grade.

### Late work

Late work is generally not accepted. If you find yourself in exceptional circumstances, talk to me well in advance of the deadline and we may be able to find an accommodation.

### Collaboration and plagiarism

Talking to other students -- especially those in the course -- about your ideas is a good thing. Taking other people's words, code, or ideas without attribution is plagiarism and will result in honor-code-related unpleasantness. When in doubt, cite. And feel free to ask me about specific cases or problems and about the mechanics of research documentation. For references and guidelines, see the library's [plagiarism](https://libguides.library.nd.edu/friendly.php?s=scholarly-publishing/plagiarism) and [documentation](https://libguides.library.nd.edu/scholarly-publishing/writing-citing) sites and the university's [academic code of honor](https://honorcode.nd.edu/).

### Disabilities

Students with documented disabilities who need accommodations or have questions should speak with me directly and contact [Sara Bea Disability Services](https://sarabeadisabilityservices.nd.edu/).
